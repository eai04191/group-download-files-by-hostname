Chrome extension to grouping download files by hostname.

Is your Downloads folder always a mess? I was tired of constantly cleaning up after files piled up. With this extension, Chrome automatically organizes your downloads into folders based on their referrer domain.

It's a simple, efficient solutionâ€”no configuration required.

## Notice for Firefox

Currently, Firefox does not support the `downloads.onDeterminingFilename` API. So this extension does not work on Firefox.
